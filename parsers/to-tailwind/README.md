We are currently working on the tailwindcss parser and we would like to hear about what your expectation of this parser.
Would you like for the parser to:
    - Generate the whole config file for you (and you can override some configs)
    - Generate the whole theme property in a file (so that you can merge it in your 'extend' property) = theme-by-specify.js
    - Generate part of the theme property in a file (and allow more control over which type of token you chose to generate) = color-by-specify.js for example

We know that Florian is really interested about this parser but any feedback is welcomed :)
